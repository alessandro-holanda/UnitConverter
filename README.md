# UnitConverter
Unit converter android app using Jscience library

This is a simple app for converting units of measurement. It's main purpose is for testing and experimenting with different libraries and frameworks.

Right now it's using:

JScience for the unit conversion.

Butterknife for view injection.

Guava to filter collections (...even if unnecessary I'm only using it for testing).
